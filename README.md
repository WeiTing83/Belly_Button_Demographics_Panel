### Result: 
In order to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer, we organize the
information as below:

+ volunteer ID is chosen from the dropdown menu so it will display the
individual’s demographic information, such as location, sex, and age.
+ Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu displays Top 10 bacterial species in
their belly buttons in each of individual’s volunteer
+ Bubble chart display bacterial cultures for each of individual’s volunteer
+ The gauge chart displays how often each volunteer wash their belly button to
understand the diversity change in bacterial species correlated with washing
frequency.
